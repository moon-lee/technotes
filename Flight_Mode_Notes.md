## Flight Mode 

1. Orbit flight mode

    * Consideration for Orbit

        * Orbit Centre
        * Orbit Radius
        * Aircraft Altitude
        * Camera Focus - x/y coordinates
        * Camera Focus - altitude

2. Orbit Mission Application

    * Autopilot - $46.99 (ipad)
    * Litchi - $35.99 (ipad)

3. DJI Go 4 POI Inteligent Flight Mode

    * How to set POI centre

    * How to set radius

    * How to set altitude

    * How to tigger camera

    * How to set Speed

4. Key Equation

    * `linear speed = radius x angular speed`

5. Minimum Radius of Point Of Interest 

    * `5M`

6. Terminology

    * `Circumference = 2 x Pi x R`
    * `Centre`
    * `Radius`
    * `Pi = 3.14`

    * Speed `30m 60 sec = 0.5m/sec`
